# Linux Commands Learning Log

Welcome to my Linux Commands Learning repository! This repository tracks my journey in mastering Linux, focusing on both the commands I learn and my weekly progress.

## Repository Structure

- **Weekly Updates**:  
  This folder contains weekly logs documenting my learning progress, challenges, and what I plan to study next. Each week, I will add a new markdown file with an update.

- **Commands**:  
  In this folder, you will find detailed documentation of Linux commands, including usage examples, options, and flags. Each command gets its own markdown file.

## Why This Repo?

I created this repository to track my progress while learning Linux and to have a reference for the commands I use. As I learn more, I’ll continue adding to both my weekly logs and command documentation.

## How to Navigate

- **Weekly Updates**:  
  Look here to see what I’ve learned each week. Each file is named by week (e.g., `Week_1.md`).

- **Commands**:  
  This folder contains markdown files for every Linux command I document. Each file explains the command’s purpose, syntax, examples, and options.

## Contributing

If you're learning Linux too, feel free to fork this repo and contribute by adding more commands, explanations, or weekly updates. I welcome collaboration!

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. I'm always open to learning from others!
